The company faced several challenges in its development and deployment processes, including
managing fragmented codebases acrossmultiple repositories, inefficient manual deployment
pipelines, and a lack of standardized environments for development, testing, andproduction.
Additionally, onboarding new team members was time-consuming due to a lack of documentation,
and the company needed scalable infrastructure to support its growing product offerings.
To address these, I successfully consolidated three separate projects into aunified repository, laying
thefoundation for streamlined collaboration and improved version control across the team.
I helped the teamestablish a consistent local development environment by configuring Docker
Compose for multi-service applications. This setup ensured that all developers, including interns as
they became ready, to work efficiently in isolated, consistent environments. Additionally, I took the
lead in designingand implementing GitHub Actions workflows to automate deployment processes,
significantly reducing manual effort and ensuring quicker delivery cycles.
The frontend application was deployed using AWS Amplify, where I set up CI/CDpipelines for
automated updates. On the backend,I established the base for Docker containerization and guided
theintegration of AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Elastic ContainerService (ECS). This
allowed for automated updates of ECS task definitions and ensured the backend services scaled
reliably. I also deployed a Flask-based API on AWS ECS,coordinating its integration with other backend
componentsand a shared MongoDB Atlas database tocentralize data management.
I created comprehensive onboarding documentation to support new team members and
established an internship program. While the interns were not fully ready during the initial phases of
theproject, I laid the groundwork for their training and guided them in understanding the company’s
software development needs.
To improve the company’sdigital presence, I developed a modern landing page using React and
Node.js. This page enhanced user engagement and effectively showcased the company’s offerings.
I also worked tostabilize the production environment and createda new staging environment,
enabling rigorous product testing and ensuring system reliability.
Through these efforts, I contributed to faster deployment cycles, improved team productivity, and a
scalable infrastructure to support growth, while fostering an environment conduciveto team
development and collaboration.
The project successfully streamlined development workflows by consolidating three codebases into
one, improving collaboration and version control. Automated CI/CD pipelines significantly reduced
deployment times, while scalable infrastructure using AWS services (Amplify, ECS, ECR, MongoDB
Atlas) ensured reliableand efficient operations. Isolated production andstaging environments
enhanced system stability and testing reliability. Although interns were not fully ready to contribute
at the time, I laid the groundwork for their onboarding and future contributions. Overall, the project
resulted in faster delivery cycles, a more robust development process, and a scalable foundation to
support the company's growth.

Problem 1: Streamlining Development and Improving Code Quality: The development team needed
to improve its internal processes to ensure maintainability, scalability, and faster delivery of new
f eatures.
To solve this, I took on a leadership role in sprint reviews, ensuring clear communication of project
progress and goals. I assigned tasks based on teammember strengths, optimized workflows, and
mentored junior developers in debugging, tool usage, and unit testing best practices. I also actively
proposed and implemented improvements to the codebase, including refactoring, introducing
forward-thinking features,and exploring novel technicalapproaches.
Problem 2: Ensuring Application Stability and Rapid Incident: The production applications required
robust monitoring and a quick response system to minimize downtime and user impact in case of
issues.
To solve this, I took on a lead role in the on-call rotation (3 weeks on,6 weeks off), proactively
testing new features in staging environments, monitoring production applicationstability, and
leading investigations into critical issueslike server crashesand 500 status codes. I also
implemented alerting systemsforboth application crashes and backend errors.
Problem 3: Maintaining active development of all three applications: While takingon leadership
responsibilities, it was essential to continue active contributions to the applications.
I balanced leadership responsibilities with active development work, continuing to contribute to the
three main applications by implementing new features, fixingbugs, and improving performance.
The combinedefforts resulted in a more stable, maintainable, andefficientapplication ecosystem.
The refactored codebase andstreamlined processesled to faster feature delivery and improved
team productivity. The integration of alarm systems and rigorous testing reduced application
crashes and backend errors, ensuring a seamless user experience. Mentoring junior developers
helped them grow their skills and contribute effectively, fostering a collaborative and high-
performing team. New features based on user feedback enhanced customer satisfaction, while the
overallimprovements increased the reliability and scalability of the applications.
